Planning for dsj 04

Branches:
    Search
    Sort 
    filter
    Paginate 

Search:
    Providing the user the ability to perform specific searches of the podcast data using the title 
        Thinking of using a linked list here (maybe not, more for frequent add/delete at random places)
        Search must have auto-complete and start loading from first letter
        Search must also account for letters from the words other than that of the first word 

Sort:
    Sort results based on alphabetical
    Sort based on newest/oldest
        Create a Map for the order of the entries based on when entered/modified and alphabetical
        Map = no duplicates, fast lookup
        

Filter:
    Genre based filter 
        I think I can just use the current mapping function that i have for genre name and use the same map to link the filter to the podcast backwards


Paginate:
    Managable chunks of data loaded at a time with numbered pages to navigate
        Have not done this much
        Need to research

Centralized state: 
    Using React state or a state management library 
        Not sure yet which I will be using 
            For smaller projects prop drilling is fine 
            I might want to experiment with a global state manager 
            I want to start using un/subscribers even if not needed yet 

All searches must be syncronized, work together concurrently, and not break with multiple state changes

Architecture choices:
    Still deciding for the most part 
        Readable state/main (global or drilling)
        Keep the data/behaviour management inside the main App component/state 
        Styling templates and variations in the passed children of components
        Subscribers to listen for specific changes to certian elements or library state management (research needed)

Tips:
    Break down each challenge into smaller chunks/branches for experimentation and learning (solution finding)
    Using vanilla test pages to understand why the framework was created and what the differences are 
    Starting with a html tailwind page, exporting into a template inside a children tag in a component, might be a more natural workflow

How I will start:
    Write all the search/sort/filter functions as normal helper functions for now 
    Make sure that they work with the current setup 
    Decide on a architecture:
        Golbal state/state library vs prop drilling
        Which components will pass props vs children
        Which elements might require changes in future (pass children)
        Are there any elements that might need variations (behaviour/(modular functions inside the main app ) passed from parent/main component)
        Using event listeners for style/layout changes and subscribers for data modifications
        Always build for SPR and ease of additions/deletions/modifications in future iterations/datasets/refactors
        Somthing to think a little about: Which areas would be better if I need a cross framework (agnostic) solution like Lit
            I might try both just to see - webcomponents seem to be very important to master in the js environment!
        Try to think a little into the future and use the correct design/DS based on what would be needed in future
        Lastly think about where optimizations can be made for performance
